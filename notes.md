<h1> Learned Today</h1>
            <p>"Learned Today" is a CLI program I made entirely in <em>Ruby<em>.
                I made the program by using different <em>API's</em> and scraping.
                The program when ran fetches a fun fact of the day, joke of the day,
                good news, etc. All the results are unique to specific day.
            </p>




<h1>Jot it Down</h1>
            <p>"Jot it down" is a simple but sleak notes app made with<em>Ruby<em>,
                <em>HTML<em>, <em>CSS<em>, and <em>Sinatra<em>. The database used to
                store the users information is SQLite. Users can loggin/logout, create new
                notes, view old notes, etc.
            </p>




  <h1>Portfolio Site </h1>
            <p>You are currently on my portfolio page. I made this just as a practice
                for my <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> skills. This was an intersting project
                because I have been focusing on back-end, algorithims, and learning databases.
                I have got out of practice of the front-end and using the client based languages.
            </p>
